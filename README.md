3. Train machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and boosting to predicit default probability
4. Evaluate model performance using metrics like ROC AUC, percision-recall curve, and calibration plots
5. Advance - Random Forest
6. Interpert model results and assess the impact of different features on credit risks
